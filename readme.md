## Project Overview

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has revolutionized digital payments in India. This project aims to provide insights into UPI transaction data, which can be valuable for understanding consumer behavior, identifying trends, and potentially optimizing payment services.

Key areas of analysis include:

* **Transaction Volume and Value:** Trends over time, daily/weekly/monthly patterns. 🕰️

* **Geographical Distribution:** Transaction activity across different cities. 🗺️

* **User Demographics:** Analysis based on gender and age. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

* **Transaction Types and Purposes:** Breakdown of transfers, payments, and their common purposes (e.g., shopping, food, bill payment, travel). 🛒🍔✈️

* **Payment Methods and Device Usage:** Insights into preferred payment methods (UPI ID, Phone Number, QR Code) and device types (Mobile, Tablet, Laptop). 📱💻

* **Transaction Status:** Success and failure rates. ✅❌
